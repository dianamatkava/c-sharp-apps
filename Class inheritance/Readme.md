There are several types of movie theater visitors:

Regular visitor(viewer) - pays the full price of the ticket, there are no discounts.

Regular visitor (regular) - for every 10 visits he/she gets an additional 1% discount, but not more than 20% discount

For example, if a regular visitor has purchased 28 tickets in the past and comes to buy 2 more tickets. He will get 2% discount for the 29th ticket and 3% discount for the 30th ticket. If the cost of the ticket is 100, he will pay 98+97 = 195 for the purchase.

Student - every third visit gets a 50% discount.

Pensioner (pensioner) - gets 50% discount for every visit, every fifth visit gets 100% discount.

The ticket price including the discount is mathematically rounded to two decimal places.

Example input data:

```
student 10 25 1
student - type of visitor
10 - number of sessions the viewer has already attended
25 - ticket price
1 - how many tickets the visitor buys
```

You need to output the total purchase price including discounts.
